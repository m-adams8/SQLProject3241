A.
Get the amount of orders fulfilled by a given employee:
R1G <-- σ(Employee_ID=Given Employee)(Employee)
R2G <-- R1G⟕Is_Fulfilled
ResultG <-- R2GℑCount(Order_ID)

SELECT E.F_Name, E.M_Name, E.L_Name, COUNT(F.Order_ID) AS Orders_Fulfilled
FROM EMPLOYEE E JOIN Is_Fulfilled F ON E.Employee_ID = F.Employee_ID
WHERE E.Employee_ID = 1
GROUP BY E.Employee_ID;

R2H <-- Payment_Method ℑ (Count(Payment_ID) → PaymentCount) (Payment_ID)
R3H <-- σ(PaymentCount = Max(PaymentCount)) (R2H)
ResultH <-- Π(Payment_ID, PaymentCount) R3H

SELECT MAX(Amount), PID.Payment_Method_ID
FROM (SELECT COUNT(PF.Payment_Method_ID) AS Amount, PF.Payment_Method_ID
FROM Pays_For AS PF
GROUP BY PF.Payment_Method_ID) AS PID;

R1K <-- σ(Stock > BookℑAverage(Stock))Book
ResultK <-- Π(Title, Price, Stock)R1K

SELECT B.Title, B.Price, B.Stock
